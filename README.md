# Parallel Bellman Ford

This project involved implementing a sequential version and several parallel versions of the Bellman Ford path finding algorithm. My work can be found under [src/main/java/paralleltasks](https://github.com/HFeeney/ParallelBellmanFord/tree/master/src/main/java/paralleltasks) and [src/main/java/solvers](https://github.com/HFeeney/ParallelBellmanFord/tree/master/src/main/java/solvers).
